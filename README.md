# Volume Control via Hand Gesture

A real-time computer vision project that enables users to control their system volume using hand gestures, powered by OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw. The system detects hand landmarks from a webcam feed and maps the distance between the thumb and index finger to the system's master volume.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking:** Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks with high accuracy.
- **Gesture-Based Volume Control:** Adjusts system volume by measuring the distance between the thumb and index finger.
- **Visual Feedback:** Displays hand landmarks, connections, and gesture cues directly on the webcam feed.
- **Modular Design:** Clean separation between hand tracking logic and application logic for easy extensibility.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Volume-Control-Via-Hand-Gesture.git
   cd Volume-Control-Via-Hand-Gesture
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   **Required packages:**
   - opencv-python
   - mediapipe
   - numpy
   - pycaw
   - comtypes

3. **(Optional) For Windows Audio Control:**
   - This project uses [pycaw](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw) for controlling system volume on Windows.

## Usage

### 1. Hand Tracking Module

The core hand detection and landmark extraction logic is encapsulated in `hand_tracking_module.py`:

- **HandDetector class:**  
  - `findHands(img, Draw=True)`: Detects hands and draws landmarks.
  - `findPosition(img, handNo=0, draw=True)`: Returns a list of landmark positions for the specified hand.

You can test the module standalone:
```bash
python hand_tracking_module.py
```

### 2. Volume Control Application

The main application is in `VolumeHandControl.py`:

```bash
python VolumeHandControl.py
```

- **How it works:**
  - The webcam feed is processed in real-time.
  - The distance between the thumb tip (landmark 4) and index finger tip (landmark 8) is mapped to the system volume range.
  - Visual cues (circles, lines) are drawn to indicate the gesture and feedback.

### 3. Basic Hand Tracking Example

For a minimal example of hand tracking and landmark extraction, see `hand_tracking.py`.

## Customization

- **Change Camera Index:**  
  Modify `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` if you have multiple cameras.
- **Adjust Detection Confidence:**  
  Tune `detectionCon` and `trackCon` in `HandDetector` for your environment.
- **Volume Range Mapping:**  
  Adjust the `[50, 300]` range in `np.interp` to fit your hand size and camera setup.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No Volume Change:**  
  Ensure you are running on Windows and have the required permissions.
- **No Hand Detected:**  
  Check lighting conditions and camera focus.
- **ModuleNotFoundError:**  
  Double-check that all dependencies are installed.
